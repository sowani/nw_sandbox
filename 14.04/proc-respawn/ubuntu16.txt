Service re-spawning mechanism
=============================

Before using these files, following steps should be completed.

1. Edit all .service files to update "WorkingDirectory" and "ExecStart" paths.
   These fields (which needs edit before final deployment) are marked with
   "EDIT_" prefix in service file.
2. Complete installation process.

#### Manual installation

```
cp kevin_aiml.service /etc/systemd/system/
cp kevin_db.service /etc/systemd/system/
cp kevin_ota.service /etc/systemd/system/
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart
```

Status of individual process can be verified as:
```
systemctl status [service_name]
```

#### Scripted installation

Assuming all modifications are done in service files, execute following
script as root user from the same directory where service files are available:

```
run.sh
```
